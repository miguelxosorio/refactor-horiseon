## Challenges

I was overthinking all the codes and didn't realize that I already have a starter code and I just needed to clean it up a little bit to resemble the mock image of the website. I went back and forth in all the classes and and id's because it felt like I was missing something. I was struggling to remove the text-style-decoration on the < header >< div >< ul >< li >. Initially I was just adding it to see how it looks like on the webpage but when I removed it on the CSS, it didn't take it off the page. I cleared my cache, and tried to look for duplicated codes in the CSS but that didn't do the trick. It may be a bug? I am not sure.

## Bugs
